## Real Playtime

Players on my server often need to know the playtime, more than something like
1.24 days as shown in the stat screen. This gives a better playtime indication
by showing the days played but also the equivelant in hours, minutes, and
seconds.

Normally I would fill out a lot of into here but this is an internal plugin
so maybe later.
